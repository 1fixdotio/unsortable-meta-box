A plugin to make meta boxes unsortable and reset their positions.

== Description ==

Draggle and sortable meta box is a very cool feature. But let users customize the UI could become painful when doing tech support online or on the phone, since she / he might reorder the publish box to the bottom of the page, and you still ask her / him to look on the top right corner at the page.

This plugin is made for:

* Make the meta boxes unsortable. The unsortable function works on all or certain pages (Dashboard, Post, Page, Custom Post Types etc.), which you could set in the options page.
* Reset positions of the meta boxes on certain pages. Do this on the options page.
* TODO - Add roles selection. (Make meta boxes unsortable or reset the positions by role.)
* TODO - Save the positions of the meta boxes for recovery later.
