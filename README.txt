Disable dragging of meta boxes and reset their positions.

== Description ==

Draggable and sortable meta boxes is one of the cool features of WordPress. But let users customize the UI could become painful when doing technical supports online or on the phone. The client might has moved the publish box to the bottom of the page, but you still ask her / him to look at the top right corner for it. Unsortable Meta Box is a simple fix to situation like this.

This plugin is made for:

* Disable dragging of meta boxes. You could disable dragging on all or certain pages (Dashboard, Post, Page, Custom Post Types etc.), which could be set on the Settings page.
* Reset positions of the meta boxes on certain pages. Do this on the Settings page.
* TODO - Add roles selection. (Disable dragging or reset the positions for selected roles.)
* TODO - Save the positions of the meta boxes for recovery later.
